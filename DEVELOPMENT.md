## Week 1 - 11/18/2020
   - Meeting to discuss team contract and project goals. First, we looked at all of our interests and based on that chose a dataset that would work with a graph data structure. 
   - We chose the CollegeMsg temporal network dataset from SNAP and decided which algorithms to implement including BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, 
     and the Strongly Connected Component algorithms.

## Week 2 - 11/22/2020
   - Kaahan organized our repository and set it up for development
   - Andrea wrote code to read the graph data and set up an adjacency matrix
   - Sreyas set up README.md
   - Isaac updated DEVELOPMENT.md
   - We worked on the test make file as a group
   - We assigned work for the following week and figured out who will work on what functions

## Update for week 2 - 11/25/2020
   - Finished implementing basic graph interface with adjacency matrix and edge list.
   - Updated Makefile to compile new header files.
   - Met to divide three algorithms among group members.

## Week 3 - 11/29/2020
   - Discussed BFS implementation and worked out issues.
   - Talked about approaches to finding the number of strongly connected components.
   - Checked in with each group member's progress.

## Update for week 3 - 12/04/2020
   - Discussed potential issues with implementation of Djikstras and Strongly connected component algorithms.
   - Met with mentor for midpoint checkin.
   - Clarified catch testing issues.
